## Competition

The goal of this Competition is to allow companies to benchmark their products against other solutions and provide a platform to broadcast knowledge about products' quality and performance.

We will evaluate both the accuracy and the speed of solutions and publish results on the [EAGE Competition page](http://competition.eage-annual-amsterdam.org:8080/lb).

After the Competition end, we will provide an opportunity for participants to examine areas with the largest errors produced by their solutions.

Details of Competition for both First Break Picking & Horizon Picking tasks are in the links below.

## Tasks
 - ### [First Break Picking](./FBP/)

	The objective of this task is to determine as accurately as possible onsets of first arrivals for each seismic trace in prestack data.

 - ### [Horizon picking](./HP/)

	In this task, we want to determine a set of distinctly visible boundaries on seismic data: they are called horizons, and denote the drastic change in rock properties underneath.
